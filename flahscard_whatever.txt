flashcard.html --> partial

when wanna put in, do 

pathname --> set_id

fetch("/api" + pathname) // Gets the info
fetch("static", filename) // gets the html thing

then, need to call some function to update it 

maybe make sep script file? need to figure out how to put event listeners tho

flashcardScripts.js --> holds the funcs for updating thing

sets.html 
holds data
has event handlers
when event, call func from flashcardScripts
update w/ data from flashcardScripts

<!-- Return an element with all of the things inputted -->
nextCard()
filpCard()

sets is just the wiring, scripts is where dom logic is
html files are templates

flashcardScripts --> create iframe and h3 objs

TODO:
fix imports by giving data as a json to the front end
move all element making functions to flashcard.js
