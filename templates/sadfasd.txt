OK, heres how forms work

forms send info when submitted, how? 

uses names and values

Sends it like name: value, like a dict in a request obj

What else? 

action in the form tags is the route the data gonna go, now doesn't redirect the user to 
that page, gotta do that w/ flask cuz thats server stuff

Stuff sent does not have to be input element!
input elements are just for the user to input data.
