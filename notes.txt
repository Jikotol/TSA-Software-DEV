Flashcard sets are only for COMMON WORDS

I need
    - A flashcard maker
        - go through csv and get info for word, then return a flashcard obj
    - pre-converted flashcards
    - vocab list that shows videos (random selection of words everytime user goes through page)
        - maybe by choosing a random gloss num?
    - need to check video func
    - need way to get definition


maybe anki inspired know level like know well, know a ittle, know next to none

Flashcards --> objects

have dict of information

entry data goes into Flashcard

access each entry from entry id

when user presses option, sends the entry id to program to make flashcard of that entry

number, region

search engine has to be STRONG!!!!
- user can misspell words
- searches by compound, user term, and variants

Links english words to dictionary, the asl bank --> needs internet access

make column for title on its definition page. for ex. 15 is on front of flashcard, but is fifteen as a title with 15 in parathesis

shows graph of what words they struggled with, with cool bar graph animations
record attempts in it, shows effort, gives celebration based on effort

want piano, zelda style celebration sound(maybe garage band or smth)

CSV can have 3 compounded words PLAN FOR MORE THAN 2

fingerspelled

ASLLRP search up data set
compound words --> asterisk represents +, keeps special notation like (1h) and fs-, but still links page

Cool idea - put handshapes in a graph with pictures
