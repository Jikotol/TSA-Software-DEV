entry name == eng term 

handedness --> if the entry doesn't have non-dominant hand shape or overidden by 1h or 2h

gloss = set()
each eng term can multiple glosses

variants -- only covers one variant :/ idk what to do with
(MAYBE) add variant_1a variant_2b for multiple variants???

notes --> stay the same, maybe sep via ";" for different sections in react later

compile entries --> similar english words from asllrp :( --> top level, string

current structure

all_words = {
    main_gloss: {
        asl_glosses: set(),
        notes: str,
        compound_word: compounded_word,
        similar_terms: str,
        handedness: int,
        variants: set(
            {gloss: str,
            notes: }
        )
    }
}
